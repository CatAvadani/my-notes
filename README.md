## Bad Code Habits: A note-taking app example

## Description

This project serves as an educational tool to highlight and discuss common bad coding habits within the context of a simple note-taking application built with Next.js and React. By intentionally incorporating various coding missteps—ranging like inconsistent naming conventions,redundant code and lack of documentation—this app provides a practical foundation for exploring how such habits can impact code quality, readability, and maintainability.

The application allows users to create, view, and delete notes, each action contains deliberate "flaws" to stimulate discussion, analysis, and correction.
Whith this project I gained a deeper understanding of best practices in software development, improved my skills in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. 

This project is meant to be used as a learning instrument for coding best practices.
